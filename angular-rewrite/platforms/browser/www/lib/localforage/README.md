# localForage [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mozilla/localForage.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mozilla/localForage)

localForage is a JavaScript library that improves the offline experience of
your web app by using asynchronous storage (via IndexedDB or WebSQL
where available) with a simple, `localStorage`-like API.

localForage uses localStorage in browsers with no IndexedDB or
WebSQL support. Asynchronous storage is available in the current
versions of all major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari
(including Safari Mobile). See below for detailed compatibility info.

To use localForage, just drop a single JavaScript file into your page:

```html
<script src="localforage.js"></script>
<script>localforage.getItem('something', myCallback);</script>
```

Download the [latest localForage from GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/latest), or install with
[bower](http://bower.io):

```bash
bower install localforage
```

## Supported Browsers/Platforms

localForage works in all modern browsers (IE 8 and above).
_Asynchronous storage_ is available in all browsers **in bold**, with
localStorage fallback in parentheses.

* **Android Browser 2.1** 
* **Blackberry 7**
* **Chrome 23** (Chrome 4.0+ with localStorage)
* **Chrome for Android 32**
* **Firefox 10** (Firefox 3.5+ with localStorage)
* **Firefox for Android 25**
* **Firefox OS 1.0**
* **IE 10** (IE 8+ with localStorage)
* **IE Mobile 10**
* **Opera 15** (Opera 10.5+ with localStorage)
* **Opera Mobile 11**
* **Phonegap/Apache Cordova 1.2.0**
* **Safari 3.1** (includes Mobile Safari)

Different browsers have [different storage limits](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/offline/quota-research/#toc-overview), so plan accordingly.

Note that, thanks to WebSQL support, apps packaged with Phonegap will also
use asynchronous storage. Pretty slick!

# How to use localForage

## Callbacks

Because localForage uses async storage, it has an async API. It's otherwise
exactly the same as the
[localStorage API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/localstorage/).

```javascript
// In localStorage, we would do:
localStorage.setItem('key', JSON.stringify('value'));
doSomethingElse();

// With localForage, we use callbacks:
localforage.setItem('key', 'value', doSomethingElse);
```

Similarly, please don't expect a return value from calls to
`localforage.getItem()`. Instead, use a callback:

```javascript
// Synchronous; slower!
var value = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('key'));
alert(value);

// Async, fast, and non-blocking!
localforage.getItem('key', alert);
```

You can store any type in localForage; you aren't limited to strings like in
localStorage. Even if localStorage is your storage backend, localForage
automatically does `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` when getting/setting
values.

## Promises

Promises are pretty cool! If you'd rather use promises than callbacks,
localForage supports that too:

```javascript
function doSomethingElse(value) {
    console.log(value);
}

// With localForage, we allow promises:
localforage.setItem('key', 'value').then(doSomethingElse);
```

localForage relies on native [ES6 Promises](http://www.promisejs.org/), but
[ships with an awesome polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/ES6-Promises)
for browsers that don't support ES6 Promises yet.

## Storing Blobs, TypedArrays, and other JS objects

localForage supports storing all native JS objects that can be serialized to
JSON, as well as ArrayBuffers, Blobs, and TypedArrays. Check the
[API docs][api] for a full list of types supported by localForage.

All types are supported in every storage backend, though storage limits in
localStorage make storing many large Blobs impossible.

## Driver Selection (i.e. forcing localStorage)

For development, it can be easier to use the
slower--but easier to debug--localStorage driver (mostly because localStorage
can easily be inspected from the console). You can use the `setDriver()` method
to change the driver localForage is using at any time.
    
```javascript
// If you aren't using JS modules, things are loaded synchronously.
localforage.setDriver('localStorageWrapper');
alert(localforage.driver);
  => 'localStorageWrapper'

// If you're using modules, things load asynchronously, so you should use
// callbacks or promises to ensure things have loaded.
localforage.setDriver('localStorageWrapper', function() {
    alert(localforage.driver);
});
  => 'localStorageWrapper'

// The promises version:
localforage.setDriver('localStorageWrapper').then(function() {
    alert(localforage.driver);
});
  => 'localStorageWrapper'
```

You can actually force any available driver with this method, but given that
the best driver will be selected automatically when the library is loaded, this
method is mostly useful in forcing localStorage.

Note that trying to load a driver unavailable on the current browser (like
trying to load WebSQL in Gecko) will fail and the previously loaded "best
choice" will continue to be used.

## Configuration

You can set database information, by giving the `window.localForageConfig`
variable a hash of options. Available options are `name`, `storeName`,
`version`, and `description`.

Example:
```javascript
localforage.config({
    name        : 'myApp',
    version     : 1.0,
    size        : 4980736, // Size of database, in bytes. WebSQL-only for now.
    storeName   : 'keyvaluepairs',
    description : 'some description'
});
```

**Note:** you must call `config()` _before_ you interact with your data. This
means calling `config()` before using `getItem()`, `setItem()`, `removeItem()`,
`clear()`, `key()`, or `length()`.

## RequireJS

You can use localForage with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), but note that
because of the way drivers are loaded using RequireJS, you'll want to make sure
`localforage.ready`'s Promise has been fulfilled to ensure all of localForage
is ready to use before you make set/get calls. Essentially, to use localForage
with RequireJS, your code should look like this:

```javascript
define(['localforage'], function(localforage) {
    // As a callback:
    localforage.ready(function() {
        localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue', console.log);
    });

    // With a Promise:
    localforage.ready().then(function() {
        localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue', console.log);
    });
});
```

## Web Workers

Web Worker support in Firefox is blocked by [bug 701634][]. Until it is fixed,
web workers are not officially supported by localForage.

[bug 701634]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=701634

## Framework Support

If you use a framework listed, there's a localForage storage driver for the
models in your framework so you can store data offline with localForage. We
have drivers for the following frameworks:

* [AngularJS](https://github.com/ocombe/angular-localForage)
* [Backbone](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage-backbone)
* [Ember](https://github.com/genkgo/ember-localforage-adapter)

If you have a driver you'd like listed, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/issues/new) to have it
added to this list.

# Working on localForage

You'll need [node/npm](http://nodejs.org/),
[bower](http://bower.io/#installing-bower), and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli).

To work on localForage, you should start by
[forking it](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/fork) and installing its
dependencies. Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and run the
following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/localForage.git
cd localForage
npm install
bower install
```

Omitting the bower dependencies will cause the tests to fail!

## Running Tests

You need PhantomJS installed to run local tests. Run `npm test` (or,
directly: `grunt test`). Your code must also pass the
[linter](http://www.jshint.com/).

localForage is designed to run in the browser, so the tests explicitly require
a browser environment. Local tests are run on a headless WebKit (using
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org)), but cross-browser tests are run using
[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

If you have Sauce Labs credentials on your machine, localForage will attempt
to connect to Sauce Labs to run the tests on Sauce Labs as well. To skip
Sauce Labs tests, run `grunt test:local`.

When you submit a pull request, tests will be run against all browsers that
localForage supports.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Will you add (or accept) support for X storage?

Maybe. If it's legacy storage (< IE 8), for a dead platform (WebOS), or
_really_ obscure (Apple Newton), I'm going to say "no". If it's for a new
browser technology or a platform-specific driver like Chrome Web Apps or
Firefox OS, then "yes" is probably the answer.

### Will you add support for node.js?

No. This is a library focused on offline storage inside a web browser. Node.js
already has lots of storage solutions. The problem this library aims to solve
is that web browsers differ greatly in their support for a common API for
dealing with the same kind of data. Node.js doesn't have that problem; if you
want to use an API, you just add a library to your `package.json`.
