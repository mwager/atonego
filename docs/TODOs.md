# TODOs

## APP ##
* we want autohide = false in config.xml but that caused the splash screen hang AFTER first submission to the app store ([maybe this helps](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/stops_at_default_phonegap_splash_screen_on_ios_iphone_5))

## API ##
* fix travis connection problems
* use redis instead of connect-mongo

* Scaling openshift (currently no cronjobs for scalable apps, senseless on free account either?)
* Security review?
* API: apn push feedback stuff (application.js @ initAPNFeedbackPolling())

### Other Todos (maybe later) ##
* Android App ? (fix scrolling and you are done?)
* FirefoxOS App !
* Windows App ? (check scrolling and 9-patch images via sdk tools...)
* google analytics tracking? (app store clicks? webapp? ...)
